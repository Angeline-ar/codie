### Project Description
This project is designed to provide students with a seamless and structured way to learn various programming languages without the confusion of selecting the right resources. By offering a well-curated learning path, it serves as the perfect kickstart to their coding journey, ensuring they build a strong foundation with clarity and confidence.

### The Problem statement
Many students struggle to learn programming because they donâ€™t know where to start. With the internet overflowing with countless resources, the sheer volume of information can feel overwhelming, making it difficult for beginners to find a clear and structured learning path. This often leads to confusion, frustration, and a lack of motivation to continue their coding journey.
